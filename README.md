# JavaScript Frameworks Course Assignment

## Project description

```
### Goal

To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.
Brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
Requirements

    All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.

**API**
The API you are using for this project can be found under Holidaze in the Noroff API documentation.

### User Stories
The client has specified the following requirements in the form of User Stories:

    A user may view a list of Venues
    A user may search for a specific Venue
    A user may view a specific Venue page by id
    A user may view a calendar with available dates for a Venue
    A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a customer
    A registered customer may create a booking at a Venue
    A registered customer may view their upcoming bookings
    A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register as a Venue manager
    A registered Venue manager may create a Venue
    A registered Venue manager may update a Venue they manage
    A registered Venue manager may delete a Venue they manage
    A registered Venue manager may view bookings for a Venue they manage
    A registered user may login
    A registered user may update their avatar
    A registered user may logout

### Technical Restrictions

    Must use an approved JavaScript Framework
    Must use an approved CSS Framework
    Must be hosted on an approved Static Host

## Getting Started with the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
